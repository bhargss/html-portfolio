<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Bhar, a newbie to front-end development. I have worked as a web developer previously and I have experience with 
  platforms like Wordpress, Wix and Elementor. I have majored in English and Social Sciences. I came to love design a lot
  in my graduation and that is what led me to shift my career path to pursue what I love.</p>

<p>When I am not learning coding, I am watching Youtube, going on walks, trying to edit videos and design stuff on Photoshop. I love to
  read books and talk with my friends as well :) I love watching documentaries, docuseries, etc. My favourite shows on Netflix are Tiny House Nation,
  Explained series, Abstract, etc.</p>
